- Drop support for attribute access - json only
- Possibly delegate to something like jsonpath for looking up data?
- Add support for lookups in containers, e.g string value in list or key in dict
- Implement robust date handling in nested structures
- Add more descriptive error messages for nested path failures
- Create regression tests for method-name keys (items, keys, values)
- Consider adding array operations (filter, map, reduce) for more powerful data manipulation
- Add type validation to ensure consistent behavior across different data structures
- Document the expression language grammar and limitations clearly
- Consider a custom path expression parser to replace the string-splitting approach
